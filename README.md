This project demonstrates a custom AI agent that can respond to a user prompt using tools and a thinking loop before delivering its final output.
This repository provides a barebones framework for a custom AI agent.
All code and functions are organized and documented.

## Usage

Get an OpenAI API Key, and define it in a `.env` file at the project root as:
`API_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to get all required libraries.

1. Define tools in [tools.ts](./src/tools/tools.ts)
2. Add the new tools to the prompt in [constants.ts](./src/data/constants.ts)
3. Modify the prompt in [index.ts](./src/index.ts)

Run the app using `npm start` from the project root.

Here is what an example output looks like.

```
Prompt: I am in Dubai, should I wear a coat today?

ðŸ§  Thinking: The user is asking if they should wear a coat in Dubai today.
ðŸ§  Thinking: To determine if the user should wear a coat, I need to know the current temperature in Dubai.
ðŸ§  Thinking: Dubai is typically warm, but checking today's specific temperature is necessary as it may vary.
ðŸ”§ Action: getTemperature with input: Dubai
ðŸ§  Thinking: The output of the getTemperature tool is 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the city Dubai.
ðŸ§  Thinking: 100 degrees Fahrenheit is very hot, so wearing a coat would be uncomfortable and unnecessary.
âœ… Output: No, you should not wear a coat today because the current temperature in Dubai is 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is very hot.
```
